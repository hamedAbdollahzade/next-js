/*? CSS Modules
Next.js has built-in support for CSS Modules using the .module.css extension.
CSS Modules locally scope CSS by automatically creating a unique class name.
This allows you to use the same class name in different files without worrying about collisions.
This behavior makes CSS Modules the ideal way to include component-level CSS. */
